## 🏗️ Project Structure

This is a **Monorepo** containing both the backend and frontend:

- `/` (Root): Django Backend & Project Configuration.
- `/core`: Main Django App logic (Models, Views, APIs).
- `/arogyamitra-react`: React Frontend (Vite + Tailwind/CSS).

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (`.env`)

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SECRET_KEY` | Django secret key for security. |
| `DEBUG` | Set to `True` for development, `False` for production. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Your Google Gemini AI API Key (Required). |
| `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` | Twilio SID for OTP SMS (Optional - has Dev fallback). |
| `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` | Twilio Auth Token (Optional). |
| `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`| Your Twilio virtual number (Optional). |

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Django 5.2, Django REST Framework, SimpleJWT.
- **Frontend**: React 18, Vite, Vanilla CSS (Glassmorphism), FontAwesome.
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini Pro.
- **Database**: SQLite (Development) / PostgreSQL (Production ready).
- **Security**: Fernet (AES-128) Encryption, OTP verification.

---

## 💡 Troubleshooting

- **API Connectivity**: If the frontend cannot connect to the backend, ensure `apiService.js` is pointing to `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. We use the IP `127.0.0.1` instead of `localhost` to avoid IPv6 resolution issues on Windows.
- **Missing Images**: Ensure the Django server is running, as it serves the media files from the `/media/` directory.
