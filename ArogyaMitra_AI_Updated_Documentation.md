# ArogyaMitra AI — Intelligent Healthcare Assistance for Karnataka Government Hospitals

## 1. Introduction

Healthcare accessibility in India, particularly within public/government hospitals, has significantly improved over the years. However, awareness, navigation and comprehension of available medical benefits remain a challenge for patients — especially those belonging to rural, low-income or non-technical backgrounds.

ArogyaMitra AI is a Smart Healthcare Platform designed to empower patients in Karnataka Government Hospitals by bridging the gap between available medical services and patient understanding. Powered by Gemini AI, it helps users identify government scheme eligibility, digitally store their hospital reports, and understand medical terms in simple Kannada and English.

## 2. Problem Statement

Despite the presence of multiple government healthcare benefit schemes (Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, Vajpayee Arogyashree, Jyothi Sanjeevini etc.), large numbers of eligible patients are unaware of the schemes they qualify for or the documentation required to apply.

Additionally, patients are often forced to physically move across hospital departments to collect and understand diagnostic reports — causing significant delays, confusion, exhaustion and anxiety.

### Identified Problems:

| Problem | Real Impact on Patients |
|---------|-------------------------|
| Lack of awareness of Govt schemes | Patients pay unnecessarily for covered treatments |
| No centralized access to reports | People walk between queues & departments |
| Medical terms difficult to understand | Leads to stress + delayed treatment decisions |
| Rural & non-digital citizens face more issues | Information doesn't reach beneficiaries properly |

## 3. Proposed Solution — ArogyaMitra AI

ArogyaMitra AI is a One-Click Healthcare Intelligence Platform that solves these problems using:

🔹 AI-driven Scheme Eligibility Predictor
🔹 Digital Medical Report Locker
🔹 Gemini-powered Report Interpretation in Simple Kannada/English

This system helps any patient in Karnataka Government Hospitals understand:

✔ Which schemes they are eligible for
✔ What documents are required
✔ How to apply step-by-step
✔ What their medical report actually means
✔ Health severity, recommendations, next actions
